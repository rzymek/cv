## Senior Software Developer
I am a truly passionate and versatile Developer with over 10 years experience, mainly in the Java and Web technologies. I tend to be the go-to guy for the most difficult technical problems in the workspace. 

I love to write clean, readable and thus maintainable code. I always ask myself whether the stuff I've just written will make sense to someone a year from now. To keep myself ahead in the game I'm closely following [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com), [DailyJS](http://dailyjs.com/) and [Coding Horror](http://codinghorror.com). I'm a proponent of Open-Source and a fan of the GNU/Linux ecosystem.

My personal development projects focus around modern Web technologies. I'm currently implementing an order scheduling system in [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com/). Lately I've written a simple webapp for sending PGP messages (running on [Parse](https://parse.com)), a [Web Map Tile Service to OSM Tiles proxy](https://github.com/rzymek/geomap) ([on AppEngine](https://geoportal-gps.appspot.com/))
and a web tracking system collecting locations from Android and [dedicated GSM devices](https://www.google.com/search?q=tk+106). 

## Skills
### Java
I've been using Java since version 1.1 - before Swing. I've started with JEE just when EJB3 and JPA came out, with all those cosy annotations replacing the XML hell of J2EE 1.4.  As for the JEE servers , I've got deeply acquainted with JBoss, Websphere and lately Wildfly.
Thanks to [Xtend](http://xtend-lang.org ) - an alternative JVM language - I've became familiar with functional programming well before the Java 8 release.  
I do know the importance of clean code - I've been maintaining and expanding my commercial side project for 8 years now. 

### Web Frameworks

Deep understanding of the underlying technologies gained with [my implementation](https://github.com/rzymek/cxxsp) (as an Apache mod) of JavaServer Pages with C++ used instead of Java.
Having worked for a few years with the heavy weight JavaServer Faces, I've [switched my interest](https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&q=user%3Arzymek&type=Repositories) to modern JS frameworks. Even with [JBoss Seam](http://seamframework.org/) and [Facelets](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/giepx.html) I found JSF overcomplicated and a real memory hog.
After checking out [Angular](https://angularjs.org) and [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/), I've chosen the full-stack [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) framework as my platform of [choice](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A211205+%5Bmeteor%5D+is%3Aanswer). 
I've used both Bootstrap 3 as well as Zurb's Foundation CSS frameworks on my side projects (just to feel the difference). I love the familiar syntax of [Less](lesscss.org). 

### Tooling
Instinctively I strive to automate all that's possible. My tools of choice are [bash](http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=votes&q=user%3a211205%20%5bbash%5d%20is%3aanswer), [awk](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user%3A211205+%5Bawk%5D+is%3Aanswer) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) with which I've setup continous delivery for WebSphere and lately Wildfly.  I also mastered [maven](https://maven.apache.org/), to the point of writing plugins for code generation using [AST](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseJDT/article.html). 
Obviously my OS of choice is Linux (which I've been using since high school) with distributions ranging from [Linux from Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/) through [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) to [Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/).   
When it comes to our Subversion and GIT repositories, I'm the one to handle all the more advanced cases at work.
As for IDEs, I've been a long time Eclipse user, just recently switching to Intellij Idea with a few months of Netbeans along the way.
