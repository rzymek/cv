## Technology Enthusiast
I am a truly **passionate** and **versatile** engineer with 20 years of commercial experience. Revolving around **Web & Java** technologies mostly. Love to bite into the **difficult problems**.

Focused on writing **clean, readable and testable code**. I always ask myself whether the stuff I've just written will make sense to someone a year from now. 

Sharing knowledge comes truly natural. I was a speaker at 2 WarsawJS meetups [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HawMf7QpeCs) [[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVLFjV8vUZk) and I've  **hosted over 30** internal **workshops** covering topics like: **Docker, Java, React, Redux, Firebase, Typescript, webpack, software engineering, git, bash**, etc.
